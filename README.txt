- *Monster Variety: I used two monster namely: black death and Decreator. Both with different outlook, health, and strength.
- Level Up: After I defeat a monster my player level increase by 1. There is a constant level factor 3, which help increase total point of a player. That makes them stronger with each level increase. So Chance to beat powerful monster rise. Fight a different monster with necessary strength gain.  
- Just try to select mana and strength intelligently so, you can beat a monster. Also, peak your health wisely. Too much health over other power will not be useful. You have to play several time to find a way to beat monster.
