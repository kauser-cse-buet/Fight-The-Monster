Bells and Whistles (or other enhancements) : 
1. *Monster Variety: I used two monster namely: black death and Decreator. Both with different outlook, health, and strength.
2. Level Up: After I defeat a monster my player level increase by 1. There is a constant level factor 3, which help increase total point of a player. That makes them stronger with each level increase. So Chance to beat powerful monster rise. Fight a different monster with necessary strength gain. 
3. Bugs: I encountered a bug of continously recreating same activity. I fixed the bug with Dr. Samuel's help. 
4. Just try to select mana and strength intelligently so, you can beat a monster. Also, peak your health wisely. Too much health over other power will not be useful. You have to play several time to find a way to beat monster. 

I think I made the game interesting. Hope you will like it.
